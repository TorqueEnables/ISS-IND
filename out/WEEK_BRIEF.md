**As of:** 2025-11-10

**Market breadth:** 34.8% above 20-DMA | 37.2% above 50-DMA

**How to use this brief:**
This is a ranked weekly view refreshed after every data upload. Focus on the top names. Use the
entry and stop levels as a starting plan and apply position sizing discipline. If a symbol gaps
far beyond the entry band, wait for a controlled pullback before acting.

## Execution notes
- Enter on strength: use a stop order slightly above recent highs or the stated entry band.
- Place the initial stop near the most recent 2-bar low or the stated stop; size positions so a single stop-out costs a small, fixed fraction of capital.
- If the setup invalidates (closes below 20-DMA after entry or the stop is hit), exit and wait for a fresh signal.
